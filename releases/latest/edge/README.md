# Kubeflow Operators

## Introduction

Charmed Kubeflow is a full set of Kubernetes operators to deliver the 30+ applications and services
that make up the latest version of Kubeflow, for easy operations anywhere, from workstations to
on-prem, to public cloud and edge.

A charm is a software package that includes an operator together with metadata that supports the
integration of many operators in a coherent aggregated system.

This technology leverages the Juju Operator Lifecycle Manager to provide day-0 to day-2 operations
of Kubeflow.
