## Supported Versions

The Charmed Kubeflow project releases with a cadence of ~6 months, supports the latest two minor versions of Kubeflow, and keeps up to date with the upstream project. Whenever a new version of Kubeflow is released, a new version of Charmed Kubeflow is also released, and the oldest version is dropped from support. Please also to [Supported versions](https://charmed-kubeflow.io/docs/supported-versions) for details on the actual versions.
