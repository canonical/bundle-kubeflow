summary: Redis is an open source, in-memory data structure store
description: |
  Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used
  as a database, cache and message broker. It supports data structures such as
  strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps,
  hyperloglogs and geospatial indexes with radius queries. Redis has built-in
  replication, Lua scripting, LRU eviction, transactions and different levels
  of on-disk persistence, and provides high availability via Redis Sentinel and
  automatic partitioning with Redis Cluster.

  This charm deploys Redis to Kubernetes models in Juju.
